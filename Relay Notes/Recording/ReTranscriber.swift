/// Apple-vs-Whisper A/B flagged in `planning/notes.md` § B).

/// This is the first real consumer of the file-based
/// `Transcriber.transcribe(_:options:)` path — until now only `MLXSmoke`
/// exercised it. The streaming path (`makeStreamingSession`) stays the live
/// recorder's; this one re-decodes a finished file.
///
/// Shares the recorder's `TranscriberFactory` (constructed once in
/// `ContentView`) so a re-transcribe reuses the already-loaded ~481 MB Whisper
/// model instead of loading a second copy. Calls serialize through
/// `WhisperMLXTranscriber`'s actor, which is the right behavior for the
/// single-model GPU engine.
